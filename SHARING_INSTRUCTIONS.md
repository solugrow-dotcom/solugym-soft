# How to Share Your Project

Since I am an AI assistant, I cannot directly send emails to you. However, you can easily share your project by following these steps:

### 1. Locate the Project
The project is saved on your computer here:
`c:\Users\pintu\OneDrive\Desktop\solugym-soft`

### 2. Zip the Project
1. Right-click the folder `solugym-soft`.
2. Select **"Compress to ZIP file"** (or "Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder").

### 3. Send the ZIP File
1. Open your email (Gmail, etc.).
2. Create a new message and **attach the ZIP file** you just created.
3. Send it to your desired email address.

### 🌐 Live Link status
I am currently trying to fix the **Live Deployment** so you can just send a link instead of a large file. Please wait a moment while I retry.
